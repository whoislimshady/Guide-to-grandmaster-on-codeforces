# Guide-to-grandmaster-on-codeforces
This will be my journey to become grandmaster on codeforces 
i am creating this because when i search on google how to be grandmaster on codeforces i didn't get any result which can actually satisfy the question all i get is just pracctice i kmow dude but what to practice and when and which question to practice 
So i am planning to go on this journey for 3 year in which i will have probably 1095 days and i will try to solve 3 question above my level everyday which will actually result in 3285 question
so there will be almost 3285 question maybe more in this repositories which will make grandmaster so when someone else in future search how to be grandmaster he will have a path and bunch of question which will eventually make ou grandmaster 2/20/2022 god i am gonna make it no matter what......
